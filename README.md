# **Bubble Tea Blast**
## *About*

This application is a bubble tea ordering simulation that allows users to select a drink with a flavor, size, and toppings and add it to their order. The intention behind Bubble Tea Blast was to create an application for boba lovers who also enjoy playing casual and relaxing  video games. The game includes personally designed pixel art to display the in-game boba shop, as well as a different image for each drink flavor.
